READ ME

    This site is a simple test website for my local family business. My media queries are embedded in my index.html and change the header and image size to  better suite mobile and larger screens. My CSS objectives are located in my contact.css and menu.css. In my contact.css and menu.css I have elements of flexbox to help better fit my contact form to mobile devices. My menu.css has a hamburger menu that has custom animation properties that rotate the hamburger and turn the lines into an x upon selection. My contact form also has embedded javascript properties. I used forms to make my contact form, and without a backend language it was difficult to store the information or prompt a "Thank you for your submission" message. My console logs "we are here" for every sucessful input and "Information obtained!" for successful forms. This is a rough first draft for a future successful website!...hopefully.
